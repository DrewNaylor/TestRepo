# TestRepo
I'm testing what could be Git problems in this repo.

Specifically, I'm having issues with line endings in my App Launcher repos when opening and compiling on computers other than my main one. Git could be having problems, but it might not be.

Also,  I'm not associated with GitHub  or Git  in any way, shape,  or form.
